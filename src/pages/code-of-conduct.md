### CODE OF CONDUCT

All attendees, visitors, sponsors, speakers, exhibitors, organisers as well as contractual and cooperation partners are bound by the rules of this code of conduct. It sets out the values, principles and actions that govern cooperation before, during and after the open source firmware conference. The purpose is to promote compliance with ethical standards and to create an environment that promotes integrity, respect and fair behavior.

### WHAT WE WISH FOR

We welcome and promote all forms of diversity. Therefore we attach great importance to inclusion and respect. This means that we are strongly committed to integration, because it is important to us to welcome our guests in a hospitable and open manner in order to meet each individual at eye level. Further, we attach great importance to respect. This means that we want all people to treat all people with mutual respect, regardless of faith, background, skin colour, gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, height, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices. We want to contribute to reduce bias, prejudice, racism, hatred and all forms of discrimination. We strongly believe, that this can be achieved through greater understanding, appreciation and recognition of commonalities among all people.

### WHAT WE DO NOT WISH FOR

We reject bias, prejudice, racism, hatred, all forms of discrimination, offensive verbal and non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, height, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public space, deliberate intimidation, stalking, consequences, harassment of photographs or recordings, persistent interruption of conversations and other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. We reject this not only at the OSFC, but also in the community, in social networks, mailing lists, chats or other spaces strictly. This also applies to any behavior that is contrary to our goals as well as any material distributed by exhibitors, sponsors, guests at the conference.

### WHAT HAPPENS IF

Violations of this Directive will be sanctioned (e.g. warning for minor offences). In serious cases, the responsible persons of OSFC reserve the right to exclude the rule-breaking attendee from the conference with immediate effect and without reimbursement of the admission fee.

### IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

If you are confronted with inappropriate behavior that constitutes a violation of this policy, please contact us directly. During the conference you can always find us at the registration point. We will assist each attendee in the event of harassment or discomfort and will do our best to assist. To ensure a safe and relaxed environment for everyone, we expect everyone involved to work together.

All attendees, visitors, speakers, sponsors, exhibitors and those involved in the organisation - commit themselves to the Code of Conduct formulated here by participating in the OSFC and thereby declare that they will comply with it. Violations of this Code of Conduct lead to consequences. Thank you very much for your understanding
