**Trustedfirmware.org is an Open Source community project that provides a reference implementation of Secure Software for Arm processors across all market segments, in both the A-Profile and M-Profile domains (from powerful application processors down to resource-constrained microcontrollers).**

The project adopts open Governance and the membership is open to all. Governance is overseen by a board of member representatives, while the Technical Steering Committee is responsible for the technical codebase, the release process and liaison with the technical community. Participating to Trusted Firmware, partners collaborate to a joint effort in solving complex security problems once and for all, sharing ownership of the foundation software all
products rely on and effectively reducing development and maintenance effort, by accelerating innovation and time-to-market. Visit our website to learn more about the project and the collaboration opportunities.
