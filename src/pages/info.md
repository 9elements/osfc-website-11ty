You can use Slack as mentioned above to coordinate.

### Hardware Table

We will be hosting our hardware table again this year. If you have hardware that

you would like to give away for free to allow others to hack on it, please feel

free to bring it and leave it on the table. The table will be located in the

hackathon room.

As always, please only take from the table what you truly want or need, ensuring

that others also have the opportunity to acquire some items.
