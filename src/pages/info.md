## #OSFC2024 – Trip Guide

Do you need help with planning your Stay? – We got you! Here we created a little #OSFC2024 Trip Guide for you!

### Airports nearby:

We recommend the Airport Dortmund (DTM), Airport Düsseldorf (DUS), Airport Köln Bonn (CGN) or Airport Frankfurt am Main (FRA) as Destination.

After you arrived safely at the Airport, the next stop is **Bochum City**! But be aware – _taking the train could be a little bit tricky sometimes_ (due to Delays or Strikes). But if you are brave enough, here are some trains you could take from each Airport:

Check out train connection yourself here: [https://int.bahn.de/en](https://int.bahn.de/en) or get the DB-App.
Alternatively, you can also get a **Taxi, Uber, Bolt** etc. that drives directly to your Hotel.

### Hotels nearby:

Here we have some Hotel recommendations for you. Each Hotel is not more than a **15 min** walk away from our Conference Location. And luckly we could gathered some special **OSFC-Discount** for you from each Hotel.

## Social Events

We’ve got some fun "After Work" activities lined up for you guys!

**Monday, September 2nd - "Drink Up"** 

If you’re already in Bochum, come hang out with us at our local bar. It’s the perfect chance to get to know each other and explore the "Bermuda3eck" together. Your first Drink is on us! Let us know if you’re coming by filling out this quick survey. [[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SNNtunrPB1iVE5Axw4wzMtktYKGQd0y589v8nKy2Cxw/viewform?edit_requested=true)]

**Wednesday, September 4th - "Aftershow Party"**

On the second day of the conference, after all talks are done we will have a party in the Venue - we will open up the gates
for external guests (invite-only) and share drinks together. You are invited to hang around, get yourself a drink, some food
and enjoy the company. Of course all rooms will stay open until ~midnight.

## Hackathon Room

Use the hackathon room to team up with the community and work on all the cool open-source firmware projects.

You can use Slack as mentioned above to coordinate.

## Hardware Table

We will be hosting our hardware table again this year. If you have hardware that you would like to give away for free to allow others to hack on it, please feel free to bring it and leave it on the table. The table will be located in the hackathon room.

As always, please only take from the table what you truly want or need, ensuring that others also have the opportunity to acquire some items.
