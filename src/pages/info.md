## Social Events

We’ve got some fun "After Work" activities lined up for you guys!

**Monday, September 2nd - "Drink Up"** 

If you’re already in Bochum, come hang out with us at our local bar [Mandragora](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Kaswr3eiP6oNW4JZ8). It’s the perfect chance to get to know each other and explore the "Bermuda3eck" together. Your first Drink is on us! Let us know if you’re coming by filling out this quick survey. [[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SNNtunrPB1iVE5Axw4wzMtktYKGQd0y589v8nKy2Cxw/viewform?edit_requested=true)]

We will meet there at 07.00 pm directly outside of the Mandragora. There is a "glass shelter" which we will be using - Don't worry, we will put up some OSFC Beachflags so that you won't miss us!

**Tuesday, September 3rd - "Meet 9elements Headquarter"**

Since OSFC is happening right where it all began, we would love to show you around our agency! We have got some cool things planned, so join us for some snacks, drinks and a nice view from our rooftop!
Doors open at 6 pm. The event ends at 11 pm. 

_Reservation needed!_ - Please reserve a seat to this event by selecting that option during your ticket purchase, or add it to your existing order.

**Wednesday, September 4th - "Aftershow Party"**

On the second day of the conference, after all talks are done we will have a party in the Venue - we will open up the gates
for external guests (invite-only) and share drinks together. You are invited to hang around, get yourself a drink, some food
and enjoy the company. Of course all rooms will stay open until ~midnight.

## Trip Guide

Do you need help with planning your Stay? – We got you! Here we created a little #OSFC2024 Trip Guide for you!

### Airports nearby:

We recommend the Airport Dortmund (DTM), Airport Düsseldorf (DUS), Airport Köln Bonn (CGN) or Airport Frankfurt am Main (FRA) as Destination.

After you arrived safely at the Airport, the next stop is **Bochum City**! But be aware – _taking the train could be a little bit tricky sometimes_ (due to Delays or Strikes). But if you are brave enough, here are some trains you could take from each Airport:

Check out train connection yourself here: [https://int.bahn.de/en](https://int.bahn.de/en) or get the DB-App.
Alternatively, you can also get a **Taxi, Uber, Bolt** etc. that drives directly to your Hotel.

### Hotels nearby:

Here we have some Hotel recommendations for you. Each Hotel is not more than a **15 min** walk away from our Conference Location. And luckly we could gathered some special **OSFC-Discount** for you from each Hotel.
