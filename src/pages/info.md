## #OSFC2024 – Trip Guide

Do you need help with planning your Stay? – We got you! Here we created a little #OSFC2024 Trip Guide for you!

### Airports nearby:

We recommend the Airport Dortmund (DTM), Airport Düsseldorf (DUS), Airport Köln Bonn (CGN) or Airport Frankfurt am Main (FRA) as Destination.

After you arrived safely at the Airport, the next stop is **Bochum City**! But be aware – _taking the train could be a little bit tricky sometimes_ (due to Delays or Strikes). But if you are brave enough, here are some trains you could take from each Airport:

Check out train connection yourself here: [https://int.bahn.de/en](https://int.bahn.de/en) or get the DB-App.
Alternatively, you can also get a **Taxi, Uber, Bolt** etc. that drives directly to your Hotel.

### Hotels nearby:

Here we have some Hotel recommendations for you. Each Hotel is not more than a **15 min** walk away from our Conference Location. And luckly we could gathered some special **OSFC-Discount** for you from each Hotel.
