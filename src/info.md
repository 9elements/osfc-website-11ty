this during the checkout of your OSFC 2023 ticket under "Special Diet".

### Goodies

### Hardware Table

We will be hosting our hardware table again this year. If you have hardware that
you would like to give away for free to allow others to hack on it, please feel
free to bring it and leave it on the table. The table will be located in the
hackathon room.

As always, please only take from the table what you truly want or need, ensuring
that others also have the opportunity to acquire some items.
