**System76 was born in Denver, CO with a passion for all things Linux and open source.**

Today, our band of merry makers are on a mission to fundamentally define the future of Linux. We create powerful desktop computers and laptops driven by function & design, and our Pop!\_OS makes discovery simple. Our work helps creators, makers, and builders engineer a better worldâ€”and have fun doing it.
