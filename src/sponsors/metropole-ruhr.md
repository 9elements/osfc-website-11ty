**The Ruhr Metropolis is home to a unique mixture of more than five million people in 53 cities - a diversity that exists nowhere else in Europe.**

The "city of cities" is a multifaceted place where metropolis meets nature and high culture meets old industry. With 22 universities, the science network is denser than anywhere else in Germany. The lively B2B start-up scene in the Ruhr valley is not only linked to this dense scientific network, but also to an industry rich in tradition. Here, continuity and a solid economy meet innovation-driven thinking, creating unique synergies and dynamics for future-oriented structural change.
