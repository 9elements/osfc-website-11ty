**HardenedVault's main purpose is to deliver a strengthened infrastructure security solution under zero trust model where the root of trust (the most fundamental building block of security) is fully hardened from hardware, firmware to OS kernel. With a secure communication protocol can be used to extend the trust from the root to all services running in the cloud or elsewhere.**
