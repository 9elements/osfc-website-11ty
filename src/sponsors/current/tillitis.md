**Our name, Tillitis, is a play with words on the Swedish word "tillit", which means trust.**

One way to be trustworthy is to be transparent. We strongly believe that security products are better and more secure when they are open. That way everyone can inspect the hardware and software design before choosing to use it. But we don't stop there, we go further and - for those who want and need - TKey is possible to program by the user. Last but not least, the architecture gives users the opportunity to develop their own security function on TKey.
