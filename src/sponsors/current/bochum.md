IT Security  
Concentrated scientific know-how : The Horst-Görtz-Institute for IT Security (HGI) at the Ruhr-University Bochum is something unique in Germany and the largest of its kind in Europe – a university for ITS. Several innovative spin-offs have already started out from the HGI.
And it’s not only when it comes to education that we are right at the forefront. Bochum is also home of numerous IST companies, including one global player whose virus protection is used throughout the world – G DATA. And – something else which is typical for Bochum – all the stakeholders in the IT sector are well connected and cooperate with each other at local, national and international levels.

And right at the heart of it : Bochum Economic Development
