**Oxide is building a vertically integrated, rack-level computer delivering the infrastructure efficiencies, software automation, and user experience of cloud computing.**

We believe that open and attestable firmware (and software more broadly) is foundational to developing higher quality, more secure systems, and is a core part of the products we are building.
