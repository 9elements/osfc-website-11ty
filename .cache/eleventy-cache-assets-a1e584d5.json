To system software including the hypervisor and kernel, SMM is a lurking black box that can asynchronously take control of all system processors for an arbitrary duration of time leading to unpredictable performance degradation. SMM code is stored on non-volatile storage such as SPI flash and loaded during firmware boot alongside other UEFI code. Over time, SMM’s ubiquity and power has attracted platform manufacturers to accumulate implementations in SMM for a growing amount of technologies that require low-level chipset access.\r\n\r\nPlatform Runtime Mechanism (PRM) is a feature that reverses this trend. It transitions code out of SMM and into the execution context of the OS/VMM by taking advantage of the fact that some code doesn’t require SMM privileges. PRM handlers execute in ring 0 just like other kernel code and can be updated in the OS without resetting the system. Developed in collaboration between Intel and Microsoft, SMI handlers are being ported to PRM handlers today. This talk will primarily discuss the fully open source UEFI code made available for any platform vendor to painlessly enable PRM in their system firmware. It will also cover changes in the ACPI Specification, the open source ACPICA iASL compiler and operating systems such as Linux and Windows to add support for PRM.","description":null,"recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6296,"code":"9DMPTB","public_name":"Michael Kubacki","biography":"Michael Kubacki is a firmware engineer at Microsoft currently focused on FW/OS interaction and core UEFI features in Azure and Surface.

Unfortunately, traditional approaches to hardware development don’t get to that step until late in the development process, making any changes expensive and time-consuming.\r\n\r\nFor example, just turning on an LED remotely requires a user experience both in the interaction with the physical product and with the remote interface. The electronics at minimum include a microcontroller, a connection path to the internet, an LED, and some way to provide power to it all. Then firmware on the physical device and software on the server and remote interface on a phone or computer must all interact with one another to deliver the necessary data and commands. The user experience can easily feel disjointed when all of these pieces are not considered and designed simultaneously.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you’ll learn how combining agile development practices with open source and/or reference designs can change the narrative on how quickly custom IoT solutions can be developed.

Sure, you and I know that they aren't great reasons, but how do you provide a more compelling argument for open source firmware?  \r\n\r\nAs the Director of Engineering for a large IoT consultancy, I routinely bridge the gap between business stakeholders and engineering.  I've spent a lot of time thinking deeply about why open source is the best business choice, and how to communicate these reasons to business stakeholders both internally, and within many of our largest clients.  \r\n\r\nWe have to face it, the fate of the open source firmware community depends on buy-in from stakeholders in an industry that differs drastically from the college dropout CS student-turned-CEO world of web development.  We need to present strong, cohesive, business arguments in order to bring our open source vision to life. I'll share what's made me successful in this domain, with the hope that others can take it and convince more companies to adopt open source firmware.","description":null,"recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6429,"code":"JWFLKY","public_name":"Jeff McGehee","biography":"As Very’s Director of Engineering, Jeff leverages his broad technical expertise to architect systems that involve intelligent machines within client projects.\r\n\r\nBefore graduating to his Director of Engineering role, Jeff was a regular contributor to the OTA (over the air) firmware update server NervesHub, applying his learnings from Very's IoT projects.
