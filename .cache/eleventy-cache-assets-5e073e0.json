The platform that was used for this enabling activity is x86 QEMU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently coreboot limits the update of certain FSP related boot parameters during compile time only. This limits developers/advanced user to make changes rapidly. Idea here is to have Micropython based UI which allows user to modify boot parameters without having to re-compile the code. Micropython can be run as alternative payload so it doesn't hinder current user experience but can provide useful tool to developers to tinker multiple parameters without re-compiling code multiple times.","description":null,"recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6387,"code":"8DGVWR","public_name":"Loo Tung Lun","biography":"Tung Lun is a senior BIOS lead at Intel Corporation focusing on BIOS and bootloader solutions design and power on activities on IOTG platforms.

Because our BMC replacement uses a lower-complexity microcontroller\r\nwith region-based memory protection instead of virtual memory, our options were\r\nlimited. We were unable to find an off-the-shelf option that met our\r\nrequirements around safety, security, and correctness, so we wrote one.\r\n\r\nHubris provides preemptive multitasking, memory isolation between\r\nseparately-compiled components, the ability to isolate crashing drivers and\r\nrestart them without affecting the rest of the system, and flexible\r\ninter-component messaging that eliminates the need for most syscalls -- in about\r\n2000 lines of Rust. The Hubris debugger, Humility, allows us to walk up to a\r\nrunning system and inspect the interaction of all tasks, or capture a dump for\r\noffline debugging.\r\n\r\nHowever, Hubris may be more interesting for what it _doesn't_ have. There are no\r\noperations for creating or destroying tasks at runtime, no dynamic resource\r\nallocation, no driver code running in privileged mode, and no C code in the\r\nsystem.

The oreboot is a fully open-source power-on-reset and romstage firmware written in Rust.\r\n\r\noreboot can boot the following:\r\n\r\n* Linux on Sifive Unleashed with M-Mode kernel\r\n* Linux on Beagle-V\r\n* Linux on x86 QEMU with Intel FSP\r\n* Linux on RISC-V QEMU\r\n* Linux on arm QEMU\r\n\r\nCurrently being brought up on:\r\n\r\n* AMD Picasso-based Chromebooks\r\n* AMD Rome on AMD Reference Board\r\n* UPXtreme with Intel Coffeelake FSP\r\n\r\nThere have been some slight adjustments to oreboot's firmware driver models. Each driver is distilled into basic functions including: init, pread, pwrite, ctl, and status. The ctl and status are new. This interface allows us to make convenient higher-level drivers such as a \"union driver\" which duplicates a single write operation to multiple drivers. This makes consoles which have multiple underlying UART drivers elegant. The oreboot driver model inspired recent changes to the coreboot console code, within the limits of what C will allow of course.\r\n\r\nBy using the Rust programming language, oreboot has a leg-up in terms of security and reliability compared to contemporary firmware written in C or assembly. Rust's borrow-checker ensures pointers are not used after freed and proves that coroutines are thread-safe at compile time. We know the stack size at compile time. There is no need for linker sets. We have the appearance of dynamically sized vectors without needing an allocator. There is no heap. Macros are safe. Rust optimizations far exceed what is possible in coreboot.","description":null,"recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":14078,"code":"FYDFMX","public_name":"Ryan O'Leary","biography":"Ryan O’Leary is a core developer of LinuxBoot within Google.

Many of these components, including firmware, are outsourced to ODMs. As a result, this limits the ability of hardware vendors to have complete control over their hardware products. In addition to creating extra supply chain security risks, this also produces security gaps in the threat modeling process. Through this research, ​we wanted to raise awareness about the risks in the firmware supply chain and the complexity of fixing known vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nThe firmware patch cycles last typically around 6-9 months (sometimes even longer) due to the complexity of the firmware supply chain and the lack of a uniform patching process. The 1-day and n-day vulnerabilities in many cases have a large impact on enterprises since the latest firmware update wasn’t installed or the device vendor had not released a patch yet. Each vendor follows their own patch cycle. Even known issues may not be patched until the next firmware update is available.\r\n\r\nWe decided to build an open-source framework to identify known vulnerabilities in the context of UEFI specifics, classify them based on their impact and detect across the firmware ecosystem with the help of the LVFS project. We will be sharing our approach as well as the tooling we have created to help industry identify the problems and get patched.","description":null,"recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":14111,"code":"FQ3VR9","public_name":"Alex Matrosov","biography":"Alex Matrosov is CEO and Founder of BInarly Inc. where he builds an AI-powered platform to protect devices against emerging firmware threats.

In the server space, Arm has hardware (SBSA) and firmware (SBBR) standards for assuring long term support, as well as providing a \"just works\" experience for end users. The Arm SystemReady program is designed to bring many of these advantages to the Edge and Iot markets as well. It is born out of the fact that much of the what makes x86 or SBSA/SBBR work are standardized firmware abstractions that create a common platform out of diverse hardware, and questioning what the minimal HW platform that is required for those software standards to work.\r\n\r\nA couple years ago, the RPi was identified as an easily available platform that could be used to demonstrate that it was possible to boot a wide range of OS's without a lot of custom driver/etc work by focusing on the firmware.

Initial measurement is crucial to platform security because the code that creates root measurement has to be secured. S-RTM (Static Root of Trust for Measurement) is found at a fixed point in time, which is the beginning of the boot process for most platforms. Typically, it is done by Intel Boot Guard, AMD Hardware Validated Boot, NXP High-Assured Boot, or other proprietary implementations. S-RTM-related measurements are recorded in TPM PCR[0-7]. Those can be used for local attestation (unsealing of secret, e.g., disk encryption password) or remote attestation. Finally, to keep the security properties of S-RTM, there is a need for a mechanism that can adjust firmware measurements after its update. D-RTM (Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement) can be established at any point in time through dedicated hardware and firmware functions. D-RTM initial measurement happens right before the execution of minimal code called D-RTM Configuration Environment, which establishes a new Root of Trust for Measurement. D-RTM-related measurements are recorded in PCR[17-22] protected by hardware through the TPM locality mechanism. Obtained measurements can be used in precisely the same way as in the S-RTM case.\r\n\r\nLet's discuss:\r\n- update mechanisms \r\n- protection mechanisms for S-RTM and D-RTM\r\n- future of related functionality\r\n- synergy: beyond RTM coexistence","description":null,"recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":6257,"code":"D8FJUY","public_name":"Piotr Król","biography":"Piotr Król is a multi-disciplinary executive running several companies in the embedded systems and semiconductor industries, including 3mdeb, LPN Plant, and Vitro Technology.

(Workshop)","subtitle":"","track":null,"type":"Live Session","language":"en","abstract":"Nowadays, it’s difficult to find any hardware vendor who develops all the components present in its products. Many of these components, including firmware, are outsourced to ODMs. As a result, this limits the ability of hardware vendors to have complete control over their hardware products. In addition to creating extra supply chain security risks, this also produces security gaps in the threat modeling process. Through this research, ​we wanted to raise awareness about the risks in the firmware supply chain and the complexity of fixing known vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nThe firmware patch cycles last typically around 6-9 months (sometimes even longer) due to the complexity of the firmware supply chain and the lack of a uniform patching process. The 1-day and n-day vulnerabilities in many cases have a large impact on enterprises since the latest firmware update wasn’t installed or the device vendor had not released a patch yet. Each vendor follows their own patch cycle. Even known issues may not be patched until the next firmware update is available.\r\n\r\nWe decided to build an open-source framework to identify known vulnerabilities in the context of UEFI specifics, classify them based on their impact and detect across the firmware ecosystem with the help of the LVFS project.

As Intel continues to release various new processors and System on Chips (SoC), the Intel team has continued to enable Slim Bootloader support for them on the respective reference platform offerings. \r\nThis talk will provide a state of art update of what has changed over the years and what we’ve learnt from maintaining it in the open-source community.","description":null,"recording_license":"","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":13609,"code":"TY3MBG","public_name":"Yah-Wen Ho","biography":"Yah-Wen is a Senior Firmware Tech Lead from the Intel Internet of Things Group.
