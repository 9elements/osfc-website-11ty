# OSFC

## Requirements

Node Version 12

## Get started

Run `npm install` and start the server with `npm start`.

## Navigation

Once Speaker, TalkList, Schedule, CFP or Tickets are needed, just add the desired point to the 'navigation.json':

{
"text": "CFP",
"url": "enter the link you need here!"
},
{
"text": "Tickets",
"url": "enter the link you need here!"
},
{
"text": "Talk List / Schedule",
"url": "/2022/talk-list/"
},
{
"text": "Schedule",
"url": "/2022/schedule/"
}

Let Nils or Denise know beforehand, so we can add the '2022' folder accordingly.
